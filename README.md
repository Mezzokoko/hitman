Trouble in Terrorist Town: Hitman Modification
==============================================
***A mysterious employer has hired professional killers to eliminate corporate enemies.***
***Will the civilians survive and reveal the hitmen who are after them? Or will those receive their paycheck at the end of the day?***

As a hitman you always have one target at a time. When you eliminate it you are assigned a new one, until your contract is fullfilled or you are killed in action. You have to avoid killing civilian bystanders. Killing more civilians than eliminated targets will result in your employer breaking up the contract and punishing you.
